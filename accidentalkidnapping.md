<!-- TITLE: Undoing an accidental kidnapping -->
<!-- SUBTITLE: In which our heroes get too close with yet another faction to get rid of an unwanted person -->

# Background
In the [Treasured Map](treasuredmap) score, the [Binders](binders) managed to *not* unload the map book, and instead ended up with [Veleris Nogaszkiyan](veleris) of [House Nogaszkiyan](nogaszkiyan) on their hands after her double-crossing of them. They don't have either the facilities or clout in the city to be able to hold her for long, but they don't want to kill her.

After some consideration they decide to contact the [Red Sashes](redsashes), a gang of organized criminals and martial artists based in [Crow's Foot](crowsfoot) that serve the interests of [House Tinnilyak](tinnilyak) in Duskwall. They get an audience with [Mylera Klev](myleraklev) and after having turned down mercenary money for hunting [Lampblacks](lampblacks) eventually come to an agreement about a handover at [The Docks](docks). 
# Factions
The [Lampblacks](lampblacks) naturally would love to interfere in [Red Sashes](redsashes) business.

The [Bluecoats](bluecoats) are anxious to recover Veleris as her disappearance is causing quite a stir in [City Council](citycouncil). The Binders carefully planned their handover during the time when the case would be handed over from local law enforcement to the [Inspectors](inspectors), though.

# Angles
# Payout
As I recall, 10 Coin was paid out in exchange for custody of Veleris.
