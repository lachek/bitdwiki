<!-- TITLE: Fitz Strathorn -->
<!-- SUBTITLE: a nobleman with esoteric interests -->

Fitz is a noble gentleman of advanced age. He does not have much permanent wealth to sustain his preferred lifestyle, but somehow still manages to get by on credit extended to him until his next windfall. His business consist of collecting curios, and any wealth he has is typically tied up on those. He does not ever part with one of his collectibles without making a hefty profit.

He dresses in a heavy ultramarine cloak and a triangular hat with a peacock feather. His face is powdered but naturally pale nonetheless and his resonant voice is starting to develop a slight waver.

Taking coach wherever he goes, Fitz has developed a terrific relationship with the [Cabbies](cabbies), and they look after each other's interests as allies. On the other hand he is loathed by the [Billhooks](billhooks) who he has screwed over on multiple occasions. [Erin](erin), one of the Billhooks' leaders-in-waiting, is actively looking for openings to assassinate him in retribution for past operations gone wrong due to his interference.

Fitz has no deep motivation or ideological outlook. He just wants to enjoy the few years he has left and be remembered after he leaves.
