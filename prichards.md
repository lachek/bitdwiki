<!-- TITLE: Prichard's Books -->
<!-- SUBTITLE: The Shadows' HQ and hideout-->

# Location
Prichard's Books is a 3-story brownstone in [Six Towers](sixtowers) on the corner of Crossway and Law. It used to house a printer's shop and bookstore.
# Features
A forged [spirit seal](spiritseal), constructed by [The Reconciled](reconciled) as a housewarming gift to the Shadows in order to keep investigators at bay. Provides the crew with the anonymity and secrecy necessary to carry out their operations.

Sufficient living space for at least 6 people.
# Description
The actual storefront is on the first floor, but the large window is boarded up and the shop door sealed with a spirit seal, "by order of the [Spirit Wardens](spiritwardens) under penalty of corporeal exorcism". The only useful entrance and exit into the building is through the back. The building has suffered tremendous water damage and an intrusive mould that must be burned off the walls is a recurring problem. However, the building offers plenty of resident room, is completely off the grid (so to speak) while still inside the city, and has a cellar with a useful space for working or studying (though presently taken up mostly by an enormous printing press machine.)

The building is for sure haunted, but these days mostly by [Nyryx](nyryx) - an associate or agent of [The Reconciled](reconciled) voluntarily (?) possessed by a vengeful, politically motivated ghost. It is by her say-so the Shadows get to stay in the HQ without being driven off by the dead.
# Background
Prichard Haig was a bookprinter, binder, and dealer in Six Towers up until last year. His clientele were not wealthy, and indeed most of his business was in second-hand resale rather than original prints, but occasionally he would get a commission from some lesser noble whose dilettante child had written something they considered worthwhile for publication. Prichard tended to stay out of trouble, yet his downfall turned out to be the printing of revolutionary flyers by the [Septimal Vengeance](septimalvengeance) cult at the behest of one of Doskvol's notables. As the flyers started to circulate [City Council](citycouncil) got whiff of it and rapidly engaged the [Bluecoats](bluecoats) to shut down the operation. Prichard was thrown into [Ironhook Prison](ironhook) and his business boarded up. The building got a reputation for being haunted, and eventually the residents in surrounding areas noted a spirit seal had been put up to deter anyone from entering.

The Shadows came to make it their home. How we do not yet know.
