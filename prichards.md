<!-- TITLE: Prichard's Books -->
<!-- SUBTITLE: The Shadows' HQ and hideout-->

# Location
Prichard's Books is a 3-story brownstone on the corner of Crossway and Law that used to be a printer's shop.
# Features
A forged spirit seal, constructed by [The Reconciled](reconciled) as a housewarming gift to the Shadows in order to keep investigators at bay.

Sufficient living space for at least 6 people.
# Description
The actual storefront is on the first floor, but the large window is boarded up and the shop door sealed with a spirit seal, "by order of the [Spirit Wardens](spiritwardens) under penalty of corporeal exorcism". The only useful entrance and exit into the building is through the back. The building has suffered tremendous water damage and an intrusive mould that must be burned off the walls is a recurring problem. However, the building offers plenty of resident room, is completely off the grid (so to speak) while still inside the city, and has a cellar with a useful space for working or studying (though presently taken up mostly by an enormous printing press machine.)

The building is for sure haunted, but mostly by xxxxxxx - a woman voluntarily (?) possessed by a vengeful, politically motivated ghost. It is by her say-so the Shadows get to stay in the HQ without being driven off by the dead.
