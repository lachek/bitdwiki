<!-- TITLE: Slate Clermont-->
<!-- SUBTITLE: The leader of the Wraiths -->

When unmasked Slate is an utterly forgettable Akorosi, an everyday, quiet, heavy-set, adult man with no significant features. He has a penchant for wearing heavy cloaks and rainboots, ostensibly because he's a practical fellow but in actuality because he can cram them full of hidden weapons and gadgets.

Slate desires change, and acts in his own patient way to subvert any agent of the establishment. His preferred mode of operation is blackmail for several reasons: not only is it potentially very lucrative in a corrupt city such as Duskwall, but even if the score goes south he is often able to use the goods to bring down or at least compromise a crony of the old order. He has political justification for this desire, but also pursue it for selfish reasons - as a man competent at analysing situations and biding his time, rapid shifts in the balance of power is destablizing for other factions but creates exploitable opportunities for him.

He shows a strong interest in gardening, is a vegetarian, and prefers solitude. He wears a Spiritbane charm.
