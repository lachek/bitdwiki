Ruby was stuck on a boat to Iruvia, but managed to abandon it and reach the mining town of Wintercliff on day 3 of her journey. Wintercliff's mayor is Lord Strangford's miserable uncle, Sir Ferrier Strangford III. After its lightning barriers fell due to a cataclysmic earthquake destroying the ancient mechanisms a hundred years ago the town's population has dwindled due to lack of living space, and replacements for the dead miners now come from convicts exiled from Doskvol or given a choice relocation in lieu of years served in Ironhook Prison. Their current means of defense against evil spirits is a hand-cranked wheel connected to a machine in the middle of town, taking 100 men to turn. Able-bodied men are forced to take shifts on the wheel for 4 hours every 4 weeks. The faster the men push the larger the barrier. Slacking off means someone's home become exposed.

(One man, Strieg Glommund, has been on the wheel voluntarily for 12 hours per day, 6 days per week for over 11 years now.)

To ship their goods to Doskvol in return for supplies and more men, each 4 week period a horse-drawn carriage leaves Wintercliff en route for the train interchange at the foot of the mountain. To keep evil spirits away, one convict considered the worst of the worst is strapped to the car roof and made to be possessed to act as a shield for the others who are hidden inside the car. The train departs for Doskvol and returns within the next day so the men can return - in the interim they have to deal with the possessed. Once they return to Wintercliff the possessed man is set ablaze and pushed down the mountainside.

Ruby and Ella has to make it out of there the only way it's possible - via train car.

An Inspector recently arrived in Duskwall in pursuit of clues about Veleris' whereabouts. The Bluecoats strongly suspect the Binders are associated with her disappearance. They do not mention the missing map book.

Roslyn Kellis is worried for Ruby - she suspects that she's had something to do with Veleris' disappearance, given that Roslyn gave her the name and she disappeared shortly thereafter. The Inspector has already questioned her, but she's said nothing other than admit that she met with Ruby a few days prior to Veleris' disappearance. 

The Cabbies (through their spokesperson Tall Benny) want compensation for their lost carriage and dead driver, minimum 3 coin (1 for carriage, 1 for horse, 1 to the driver's surviving son Thurmund.)

The Inspector:
Rudrice Peremoth, Akorosian originally from Cloudspire, plump 50-something with angry red hair and small round spectacles. Dresses conservatively. Highly competent. Has a strong interest in ships. Secret alcoholic.
His bodyguard Pemryck, a gruff and harsh 30-something armed with a warhammer (that he's also adept at suddenly throwing) and a powerful flintlock pistol (harm 3).

Score ideas:

Kill the inspector. This is entirely possible but will create a lot of commotion and attention (essentially, a lot of Heat).
The Inspector is not an idiot and will be well protected. A ghost field charm saves him from a single shot *or* a ghostly attack. Pemryck ensures all his food and drink is tasted before he gets into it. The Bluecoats are ostensibly also sworn to protect any Imperial representatives from harm and 2 officers are supposedly assigned to Rudrice at all times, but the Bluecoats can easily be paid off to look the other way or even help out with a conspiracy.

Frame someone else. This is a major operation.

Just avoid capture until Veleris is discovered safe in Iruvia, and the heat dies down a bit - then avoid capture after her testimony comes out.
Rudrice will be on their tail and will eventually track them down and arrest them unless they can evade him better. Their contacts may become compromised however.
