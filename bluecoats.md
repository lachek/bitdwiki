# Relationship to PCs
The Bluecoats don't have anything on the Shadows yet, but that won't stop them from harassing them to the extent the law permits - which is a lot.
However, since the Shadows are new on the scene, some in the Bluecoats may be willing to overlook some of their operations if they agree to act as informants and double-cross the competition.
# Turf
